## Abstract 

We develop a quantum simulation-based approach for studying properties of strongly correlated magnetic materials at increasing scale. We consider a paradigmatic example of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state hosted by the honeycomb Kitaev model and use a trainable, symmetry-guided ansatz for preparing its ground state. Applying the tools of quantum subspace expansion (QSE), Hamiltonian operator approximation, and overlap measurements, we simulate the QSL at zero temperature and finite magnetic field, thus moving outside of the symmetric subspace. Next, we implement a protocol for quantum subspace expansion-based measurement of spin-spin correlation functions. Finally, we perform QSE-based simulation of the dynamical structure factor obtained from Green’s functions of the finite field Kitaev model. Our results show that quantum simulators offer an insight into quasiparticle properties of strongly correlated magnets and can become a valuable tool for studying material science.
